# Service-Website

Project Overview 
University of Northern Iowa Metal Casting & Foundry 4.0 Centers 



A company required a website to showcase its available services, enable users to select any number of services, and calculate a subtotal based on their selections. The most effective approach involved developing an interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project emphasized user-friendly design, dynamic interactivity, and real-time calculations to improve the customer experience.

# Key Technologies Used: 
-	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – Structured the website’s content
-	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – Styled and formatted the interface for a visually appealing design
-	JavaScript – Enabled interactivity, including dynamic service selection and subtotal calculation
-	Visual Studio Code – Used as the primary development environment
  
# Learning & Technical Growth:
Before this project, I had no prior experience with HTML or CSS. To bridge this gap, I studied HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett, which helped me understand how HTML structures a webpage while CSS controls its presentation. Additionally, I explored JavaScript to introduce functionality, such as interactive service selection and a reset button, enhancing the user experience.

# Challenges & Solutions:
-	Learning new technologies – Overcame this by leveraging structured resources like books and online documentation.
-	Integrating JavaScript with HTML & CSS – Implemented fade-in transitions and a reset button for user convenience
-	Ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design – Applied CSS techniques to improve layout and usability.
  
# Future Opportunities:
This company can use this website in the future to create more visibility and therefore generate more revenue. This is good for business and business practices.
